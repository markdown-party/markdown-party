# Week 11 (2021.03.19)

## Documentation & learning

+ Went through multiple KMM and KotlinJS tutorials.
    - I managed to create Gradle projects with Kotlin multi-platform modules and a JVM target, but **didn't quite figure out how to make the KotlinJS target compile and how to serve it (yet)**.
    - Tested coroutines defined within KMM code, especially the `Flow`, `Mutex`, `Channel`, `select { ... }` primitives. They all seem to work as expected when used from the JVM target.

+ Looked at the 7 Kotlin-only libraries with the term "CRDT" in their name, tags or description [(GitHub)](https://github.com/search?l=Kotlin&q=crdt&type=Repositories).
    - I added a few notes about each of these in the `Architecture.md` document.
    - [Concordant](https://github.com/concordant/c-crdtlib), the newest library of the batch, seems to be the most similar to what I'm doing. It's still in very early stages, and does not support custom CRDTs (even though it supports some [counters](https://github.com/concordant/c-crdtlib#counters), [registers](https://github.com/concordant/c-crdtlib#registers), [sequences](https://github.com/concordant/c-crdtlib#collections) and [maps](https://github.com/concordant/c-crdtlib#maps)). Interestingly, it's developed by a team led by Marc Shapiro.

+ Read the following ressources :
    - [An introduction to state-based CRDTs](https://bartoszsypytkowski.com/the-state-of-a-state-based-crdts/) (read 8/10 articles, skipping "Bounded counter" and "JSON document" for now)
    - [To OT or CRDT, that is the question](https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/real-time-collaboration-ot-vs-crdt/)

## Deliverables

+ Added some library usage samples for a `LWWRegister` and a `GSet` in [`kotlin-echo`](https://github.com/markdown-party/kotlin-echo/tree/main/src/test/kotlin/markdown/echo/demo).
+ Worked on the `ARCHITECTURE-OLD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE-EN.md` documents.

# Plans for next week

+ Merging both `ARCHITECTURE-OLD.md` and `ARCHITECTURE-EN.md` documents.
+ Adding more complex CRDT samples (PNSet, PNCounter, sequence, ev. tree prototype).
+ Setting up a working KotlinJS project.

# Possible problems

+ Additional issues with KotlinJS.
	- I will possibly ask for some help on the Kotlin Slack if I remain stuck. I hangout there a lot to follow what's happening on #android and #compose / #compose-desktop but there is a #javascript channel too.
