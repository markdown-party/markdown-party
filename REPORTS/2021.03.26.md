# Week 12 (2021.03.26)

## Deliverables

+ Added some usage samples in [`kotlin-echo`](https://github.com/markdown-party/kotlin-echo/tree/main/src/test/kotlin/markdown/echo/demo).
    - `PNCounter` is a positive / negative counter.
    - `String` is a simple sequence of `Char`. It supports two primitive operations : inserting a `Char` after an existing `Char`, or deleting a specific `Char`.
+ Refactored a huge portion of `kotlin-echo` in order to :
    1. Offer a more flexible API when creating CRDT (used in the `String` sample).
    2. Introduce `Exchange`, `Site`, `MutableSite` which replace `Echo` and `SiteEcho`. This separation makes it possible to create "passive" `Exchange` or `Site` which only transmit events and can't yield them.
    3. Make some optimizations possible in `MutableSite` (through custom `MutableEventLog` and projection implementations).
    4. Improve the finite state machine implementation from the replication protocol.
+ Improved the [Architecture](_ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

# Plans for next weeks

+ **Week 1** : Re-organize the repository and the design documents
+ **Week 1 + 2** : Set up a structure for the intermediate report
+ **Week 2** : Migrate the replication library + backend + frontend explorations to a mono repository

# Possible problems

+ Same as _Week 11_
