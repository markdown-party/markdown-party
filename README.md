# Markdown Party

Welcome to the **Markdown Party** GitHub repository ! **Markdown Party** is the title of the product I'm developing for my Bachelor Thesis at HEIG-VD; it's a web-based collaborative editor available [online](https://markdown.party).

This repository acts as a centralized entry point to the different reports, repositories and resources that I'll use or create for this project.

## Source code

You can check out the source code in the following places :

- [kotlin-echo](https://github.com/markdown-party/kotlin-echo), where a reference implementation of the log replication protocol and data structure is maintained;
- [kotlin-backend](https://github.com/markdown-party/kotlin-backend), where a collaborative Markdown synchronisation server is developed; and
- [elm-frontend](https://github.com/markdown-party/elm-frontend), where a SPA frontend is developed.
